This project allows us to keep tabs on different aspects about a plants wellbeing, taking advantage of tools such as sensores and NodeMCU ESP8266, inserting the measured data to an SQL database. The sensors that we employed are: 


* Distance infrared sensor
   * We built a tank, and used HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Distance Sensor to check if the tank is empty
* Humity sensor
   * We built a tank, and used HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Distance Sensor to check if the tank is empty and needs a refill.
* Temperature sensor
   * We built a tank, and used HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Distance Sensor to check if the tank is empty
* Light sensor
   * We built a tank, and used HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Distance Sensor to check if the tank is empty
* Movement sensor
   * We built a tank, and used HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Distance Sensor to check if the tank is empty and needs a refill.
